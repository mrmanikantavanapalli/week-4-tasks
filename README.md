"# Task 1: Working with STL AlgorithmsGoal:Practice commonly used STL algorithms in the context of managing HMI control states (e.g., button visibility, slider values).Overview:Data Structure: A Control struct is used to store the ID, type (button or slider), and state (visible, invisible, disabled) of each control.STL Algorithms Used: std::for_each, std::find, std::find_if, std::adjacent_find, std::count, std::count_if, std::equalSteps:Iterate through all controls and print their details.Find controls based on specific conditions (e.g., finding invisible controls or counting visible ones).Task 2: Iterating Through Containers and Finding ElementsGoal:Practice iterating through containers and retrieving specific elements.Overview:Containers: A std::vector is used for dynamic widgets, and a std::set for static widgets.Iterators and Search: Use iterators to print dynamic widgets and std::set::find to check for specific static widgets.Steps:Print all dynamic widgets.Find specific widgets like "WarningLights" in the static widgets container.Task 3: Advanced STL OperationsGoal:Perform advanced operations such as transformations and conditional modifications on HMI states.Overview:State Manipulations: Temporarily disable all controls, generate random states, and apply transformations like changing states or removing invisible controls.Steps:Backup the control list.Fill controls to a default state (disabled).Transform and replace control states (e.g., "disabled" to "enabled").Filter out invisible controls.Task 4: Sorting, Searching, and MergingGoal:Practice sorting, searching, and merging in an HMI-related context.Overview:Sorting: Sort controls by ID and maintain their relative order using std::stable_sort.Search: Use binary search to find a control by ID.Merging: Merge two sorted lists of controls.Steps:Sort and search controls based on their IDs.Merge two sorted lists of controls.Use set operations to identify common and unique controls.Task 5: Implementing Design Patterns in HMIGoal:Implement and understand the Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy design patterns in the context of HMI systems.Overview:Singleton: A HMISystem class to manage the overall HMI state.Factory: A factory to instantiate different types of controls (Button, Slider, etc.).Observer: An observer pattern to notify widgets when the system switches modes (e.g., Day/Night mode).Strategy: A strategy pattern to define different rendering behaviors (e.g., 2D vs. 3D)."
